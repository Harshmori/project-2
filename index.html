        <p class="para">Our Partners in Education Foundation enables local organizations to connect with schools or programs within Harward  Schools. The purpose is to enrich and expand the educational opportunities of Harward students while promoting a deeper understanding of the school system within the community.
            <br>
            <br>By establishing personal relationships between community leaders and educators, our goal is to create a spirit of involvement that has a positive impact on Harward. This involvement helps local schools become places where community members work with students 
            and help prepare them to succeed in an ever-changing world.
